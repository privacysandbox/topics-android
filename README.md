# Topics Taxonomy

This repository is meant to be a place to reference the current and past
versions of the topics taxonomy for apps released as part of the Android Privacy
Sandbox. In this repo are markdown files for each iteration of the Taxonomy with
their version number appended to the end of the filename.

- This taxonomy is human-curated so that sensitive topics are not part of the
  taxonomy.
- This taxonomy is tailored to the categories of ads that can be shown on mobile
  apps on Android.
- The [taxonomy is open source][1], and subject to change.
  Suggestions can be filed via the [feedback form][2].
